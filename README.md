This is my "private/public" fileshare repository for a project called Vocappulary.

Vocappulary is a wWindows Mobile App that is available since 2014.

In 2017 Microsoft went slightly berserk and they decided to discontinue already paid and valid online contracts - my public website including all data repositries for my app are just switched off from one day to another.

As for the public website it is not an urgent matter to find a replacement. As my urge to present myself is rather limited, I can take my time to find a new, more reliable web hoster and set up the pages.

But, in Vocappulary I have some basic functionality that uses certain public files _ sample data templates, some service fomrating template for an external web service called Verbix and some quick version info that is being read upon every start of the app - kind of poor peoples push messaging :-)

Well, as quick replacement I decided to push my files to github - no secret information there, you are welcome to sniffle into - but being app specific data, this repo will not give you much...

Cheers, RJereb
