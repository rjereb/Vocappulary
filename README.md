This is my "private/public" fileshare repository for a project called Vocappulary.

Vocappulary is a Windows Mobile App that is available since 2014.

In 2017 Microsoft went slightly berserk and they decided to discontinue already paid and valid online contracts - my public website including all data repositories for my app are just switched off from one day to another. The best part of it: not even an email was considered necessary - just some popup message on the administration website. So if you do not change your public website for a while and do not log in as the website admin, you are not even informed, that your paid public website goes offline. The monthly fee for the service is being charged - just the service offered for it has been "slightly" changed.

As for the public website it is not really an urgent matter to find a replacement, as my urge to present myself is rather limited. I can take my time to find a new, more reliable web hoster and set up the pages again.

But, in Vocappulary I have some basic functionality that uses certain public files - like sample data, some service fomrating template for an external web service called Verbix and some quick version info that is being read upon every start of the app - kind of poor peoples push messaging :-)

Well, having a few customers, who purchased the full version, I cannot let them down, like Microsoft did with me... As a quick replacement I decided to push my files to github... There is no rocket science or secret information there, you are welcome to sniffle into - but being app specific data, this repo will not give you much...

Cheers, RJereb
